# Description
This resource pack changes the story of Minecraft from that of a survivor in a pre-modern world to that of a space-human exploring a strange new planet, one whose peace is threatened by evil cyborgs and alien invaders. 

Will you free the bird-like people of this once-great world? Or conquer them in the name of humanity?

# Installation
Simply download one of the release .zip files and put it in the *resourcepacks* folder inside your Minecraft profile folder (default location is *~/.minecraft* where ~ is either your home directory (unix-like computers) or *C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming* (windows computers)).

# 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 Resolution
This resource pack is available in 4 different resolutions. Note that StarTracks-MCRP **does not replace all default textures**, so if you are using 32x32 or higher resolution, you chould pair this resource pack with another of the same resolution (e.g. [Minecraft HD(64x) by Mrdhobbs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/minecraft-hd-64x-fan-updated-by-mrdhobbs) ) to update the other Minecraft textures not touched by StarTracks-MCRP.
