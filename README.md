# StarTracks-MCRP
This is a Sci-Fi themed resource pack for Minecraft.

This resource pack changes the story of Minecraft from that of a survivor in a pre-modern world to that of a space-human exploring a strange new planet, one whose peace is threatened by evil cyborgs and alien invaders. 

Will you free the bird-like people of this once-great world? Or conquer them in the name of humanity?
