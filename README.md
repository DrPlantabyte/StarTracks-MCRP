# StarTracks-MCRP
This is a Sci-Fi themed resource pack for Minecraft.

# Description
This resource pack changes the story of Minecraft from that of a survivor in a pre-modern world to that of a space-human exploring a strange new planet, one whose peace is threatened by evil cyborgs and alien invaders. 

Will you free the bird-like people of this once-great world? Or conquer them in the name of humanity?

# Installation
Simply download one of the release .zip files and put it in the *resourcepacks* folder inside your Minecraft profile folder (default location is *~/.minecraft* where ~ is either your home directory (unix-like computers) or *AppData/Roaming* (windows computers).

## Warning!
You must set your **GUI Scale** to **normal** or **large** in the **Video Settings...** menu screen (text will not be legible if the GUI scale is set to *small* ).

## Spacesuit Physics
To enable spacesuit physics, copy the contents of the *world* folder extracted from *world.zip* into your saved game or server world folder. Then execute the command **/function startracks:init** (you may need to run the reload command first). This will install the *startracks:spacesuit_update* function into the game.

While active, spacesuit physics will allow any player wearing any helmet to breath underwater. However, if you are *not* wearing a full suit of armor in other dimensions, you will suffocate quickly.

To create a zone of breathable air (in creative mode), set the blocks at Y+128 (~128) to minecraft:barrier blocks (or other non-air block).

To disable spacesuit physics, execute the command **/gamerule gameLoopFunction - **.

## Building the resource pack
To compile this resource pack, you must have the following programs installed on your computer:
- Python 3+
- Inkscape
With these programs installed, you need only run the *build.py* python script to generate the resource pack .zip files, which will appear in the *distributables* folder.
