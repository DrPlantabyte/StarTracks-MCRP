# Description
This resource pack changes the story of Minecraft from that of a survivor in a pre-modern world to that of a space-human exploring a strange new planet, one whose peace is threatened by evil cyborgs and alien invaders. 

Will you free the bird-like people of this once-great world? Or conquer them in the name of the Terran Space Union?

# Installation
Simply download the release .zip files and put the resource pack files in the *resourcepacks* folder inside your Minecraft profile folder (default location is *C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft* (windows computers) or *~/.minecraft* (unix-like computers)).

To install the data pack, when creating a new world, click *Data Packs* and then *Open Pack Folder*. Then copy the datapack .zip file into that folder and then click the purple triangle to add the data pack to your game.

# 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 Resolution
This resource pack is available in 4 different resolutions. Note that StarTracks-MCRP **does not replace all default textures**, so if you are using 32x32 or higher resolution, you should pair this resource pack with another of the same resolution (e.g. [Minecraft HD(64x) by Mrdhobbs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/minecraft-hd-64x-fan-updated-by-mrdhobbs) ) to update the other Minecraft textures not touched by StarTracks. Move StarTracks to the top of your installed resource packs list.
